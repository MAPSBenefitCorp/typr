# Prototypr Editor

This is the editor from the core prototypr-frontend package. 

I just started splitting it out, so there's still work to do before it becomes usable.

The goal is to make it easy to drop into any React project.


install with 
`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

## Local development

Clone the folder `prototypr-packages/typr` and run `npm install`

### Watch script
Use watch script in package.json in typr to automatically rebuild on changes:

run `npm run watch` in the typr directory while developing.
